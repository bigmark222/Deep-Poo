# Commercial License

This project is licensed under AGPLv3. The implementation is a reduced, simulation/education-focused demonstration inspired by inchworm-style anchoring/extension concepts; it does not replicate proprietary hardware or clinical configurations.

**No patent license is granted under this notice.** Any commercial use that practices patented methods or claims requires a separate license from the patent holder. The commercial license for this repository only covers the project’s source code and original supervisory/control logic.

If your organization wishes to use this software without the obligations of the AGPL (such as releasing source code), or needs rights to practice any relevant patents, commercial licenses are available. Please contact: `<your-contact@domain>` for inquiries.
